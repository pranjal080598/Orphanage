Orphanation is a PHP based website that is developed to help the orphanages and orphans in India. There are various orphanages who aren't aware of people who actually
want to donate to these orphans . We connect these orphanages to the donors. Every orphanage and donors need to register on the website. Donors click the picture of the
item they want to donate and post it on the website. An orphanage who needs that item can add the item to its cart and checkout. A delivery person is assigned to this
transaction. The delivery person picks the item from the donor and gives it to the orphanage. Therefore a smooth process is carried out for the orphanages as well as
the donors. To use the project:
1. Download/Clone the repository
2. Start the server(Tomcat and MySQL)
3. Import the database (check for the entries)
4. Run index.php
